/*
 * Basic Thread Creation:
 * 
 * Task: Write a program to create two threadsâ€”one prints numbers from 1 to 10, and the other prints letters from 'A' to 'J'.
 * Steps:
 * Define tasks for printing numbers and letters (hint: use a method or class to encapsulate the logic).
 * Create two threads by implementing a way to define executable tasks (hint: consider a common interface for tasks).
 * Start both threads and observe the interleaved output due to concurrent execution.
 * Add a small delay (e.g., pause for 500ms) in each iteration to simulate work and make interleaving visible.
 * Goal: Understand thread creation and concurrent execution.
